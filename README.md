<h2>A portfolio page for my projects, built with React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS</h2>

<h2>Functionality and purpose of the application</h2>
<p>
This is a personal page for me, my skills and my projects. It was built with React and Next.js, and the CSS part was made totally with Tailwind CSS for a clear styling and complete responsiveness. The projects section includes a thumbnail, short description, Github repository link and a live version link of each project.

The page also features an eye appealing dark mode.
